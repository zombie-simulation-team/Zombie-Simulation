# Multiverse Zombie Apocalypse

## Travis build status: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/zombie-simulation-team/Zombie-Simulation.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.com/zombie-simulation-team/Zombie-Simulation)

This project is an application that simulates an infectious disease, similar to a zombie apocalypse, that spreads throughout the world. The application will be able to run on many of the common operating systems used today such as Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. Also, available to perform and work on ARM or x86 processors.

### Application Resources
***
Because of our defined idea in making a light GUI we were able to obtain great performance on our implementation. At maximum we only used approximately 41MB(39,932KB) of memory, and in respect to the Beaglebone that represents only 8% of its 512MB of RAM. Those values can be obtained in the terminal after running some commands to display memory usage.
